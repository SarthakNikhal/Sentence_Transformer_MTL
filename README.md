# Sentence Transformers + Multi-Task Learning

This repository contains an implementation of a sentence transformer model extended for multi-task learning (MTL), addressing both sentence classification and sentiment analysis tasks.

## Overview

- **Task 1:** Sentence Transformer using DistilBERT with mean pooling.
- **Task 2:** Multi-task architecture with two heads for classification and sentiment.
- **Task 3:** Explanation of freezing strategies and transfer learning setup.
- **Task 4:** Training loop handling two tasks with shared encoder.

## Installation

### Using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentence-transformers-mtl.git
cd sentence-transformers-mtl
pip install -r requirements.txt
